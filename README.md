Hi, I’m @ArathM, a senior undergrauate engineering physics student taking a minor in data science. 
I'm interested in physics simulations ranging from molecular dynamics to fluid dynamics, and have experience in programming of autonomous vehicles using ROS, with computer vision and ml algorithms for navigation.
I’m currently working on my data science minor and a fluid dynamics simulation in Julia
